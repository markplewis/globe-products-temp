      <b>Is it safe to receive the newspaper through home delivery?</b>
      <br>
      According to a recent statement from The World Health Organization (WHO): “The likelihood of an infected person
      contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that
      has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperate is also low.”
      <br><br>
      <b>What are you doing to ensure the safe delivery of the newspaper?</b>
      <br>
      All of our delivery partners and newspaper carriers are taking the necessary precautions to:
      <ul>
        <li>Follow public health recommendations regarding handwashing and other hygiene issues.</li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect touched areas and surfaces frequently.</li>
        <li>Maintain social distancing of two metres.</li>
        <li>Report changes in health status to The Globe.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>I live in a building. Why have you stopped delivering to my unit door?</b><br>

      We may have been instructed by property management to temporarily deliver your copy of The Globe and Mail to the
